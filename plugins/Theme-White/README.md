The Plex Theme will only change the look and feel of the Stash interface. It will not affect any other data, so you are all safe and sound! :heart:

## Install

1. Open User Interface Configuration panel in settings. (http://localhost:9999/settings?tab=plugins)

2. Find the Theme in the listing, in the default Community repo

3. Click Install
